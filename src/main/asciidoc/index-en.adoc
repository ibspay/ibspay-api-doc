== Description of The Document

API Document for IBS Payment Gateway
++++

=== Version

* 2017-09-05 +
Version 1.0.0


=== Global Planning

* Server address: \https://api.payingcloud.cn
* Data Format: json
* The asynchronous notification interface must return "success" when it was completed.

=== Signature Rules

HTTP requests should add a kbd:[*Authorization*]' Header to include ‘Signature’that the message has been authorized.

.Signature
[source,Java]
----
 HmacUtils.hmacSha1Hex(               //<1>
                key,                  //<2>
                verb + "\n" +         //<3><4>
                resource + "\n" +     //<5>
                body + "\n" +         //<6>
                timestamp + "\n");    //<7>
----
<1> Using hmacSha1 algorithm to get the M-16.
<2> kbd:[*key*]——Signature required keys that is generated in the console.
<3> kbd:[*verb*]——HTTP request Method that include PUT, GET, POST, HEAD, DELETE.
<4> kbd:[*\n*]——newline
<5> kbd:[*resource*]——Stitching parameter string is used for the request interface.
kbd:[*path*]+kbd:[*?*]+kbd:[*query*]
<6> kbd:[*body*]——Content of the request body
<7> kbd:[*timestamp*]——Said the operation time, and must be in GMT format,like "Sun, 22 Nov 2015 08:16:38 GMT". This timestamp will also be added to * Header *,and the key is * Date *. +

.Remark
____
The signature body of the HttpMethod without the request body is represented by an empty string.
____

.For Example:
[source,Java]
----
HmacUtils.hmacSha1Hex("3zKciJOwhWE4SSRUxXzCsABcIhJWd5Gb",
                      "POST" + "\n" +
                      "/charges?a=a&b=b&c=c" + "\n" +
                      "{"a":"a","b":"b","c":"c"}" + "\n" +
                      "Sun, 22 Nov 2015 08:16:38 GMT" + "\n"
----

Add your signature to kbd:[*accessKeyId*],then base64 encoding.Add the result to the kbd:[*Basic* + *blank*] to  compose kbd:[*Authorization*].

.Authorization
[source,java]
----
"Basic " + Base64.encodeBase64String((accessKeyId + ":" + signature).getBytes()));
----

.Final Header
[source,Header]
----
Content-Type:application/json; charset=UTF-8
Authorization:Basic NTgzMTM1NDZlZjE5MGM1MWMwYmVhYzZmOjA2NzY2NTUwMzdhOTQyZDc5M2JjOGM5YzRmNzE5M2QzZTRhYjY5YjE=
Date:Tue, 13 Dec 2016 03:22:13 GMT
----

=== Checking Steps
In order to prevent damage caused by hackers fake transaction results,all asynchronous notification using RSA signatures were sent to the merchant.And put the signature with Base64 encoding in Http request headers kbd: [*sign*].Developers need to use SHA1WithRSA algorithm and IBS provides RSA public key to validate it. +

.For Example:
[source,Java]
----
// Gets a signature from asynchronous notification request headers.
String sign = request.getHeader("sign");
// Using base64 decoding the signature String to bytes.
byte[] signBytes = Base64.decodeBase64(sign)
//Gets the asynchronous notification request body.
String content = ...
// Using UTF-8 character to decode the request body.
byte[] contentBytes = content.getBytes("UTF-8")
// SHA1WithRSA algorithm is used to validate it.
KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance("RSA");
byte[] encodedKey = Base64.decodeBase64(PayingCloud.DEFAULT_PUBLIC_KEY); // 使用PayingCloud提供的RSA公钥
PublicKey key = keyFactory.generatePublic(new X509EncodedKeySpec(encodedKey));
Signature signature = Signature.getInstance("SHA1WithRSA"); // 验签算法SHA1WithRSA
signature.initVerify(key);
signature.update(contentBytes);
return signature.verify(signBytes);
